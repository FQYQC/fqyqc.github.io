## Preface

As my first long journey, I spent about two weeks planning this trip. I drew heavily on lots of previous journey logs and resources, so I’d like to express my thanks in advance; the main references are listed in the acknowledgments at the end of the full text. Due to my own decisions on the road and objective factors in transport, plus making things line up with lodging, there are some differences from my original plan. The first and last rides of each day usually connect to the place I stayed, not strictly to the “must-do” journey nodes. If there are any mistakes in the journey report, I welcome readers to point them out.

Some notes on the information in this journey report:

* Some original prices are missing because I couldn’t confirm the original fare.
* For payment methods, “QR code (inside station)” means you need to buy the ticket in advance inside the station.
* Route numbers are based on a combination of map information and what locals call them. A number without a prefix usually refers to a prefecture-level city’s local bus route; in the text I add the city name in parentheses beforehand to clarify.
* In the journey plan / journey report, the administrative region marked in red is the region that actually operates the route. Vehicles from within that region are not specially annotated.
* The journey took place from January 14 to January 22, 2024.

All transport costs for this journey were kindly sponsored by Genso Fuubi, and portable charger support was provided by tosaki — huge thanks to both.

## Journey Plan

The figure below is the journey plan I made for this trip, with the collected bus operating times omitted. Since the plan wasn’t fully polished, there are quite a lot of errors and missing info. The actual journey broadly followed this plan, but there were also plenty of changes.
![Journey plan for this trip. The actual route ended up being different.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/01.png)

## Journey Report

Below is the actual journey record corresponding to the plan. While organizing the logs, I tried my best to keep the information accurate and true to reality, and to match the route details with how things were operating during the journey. That said, because of missing records, route adjustments, and other factors, some information may differ from the situation at the time of travel / at the time of publication / when you are reading this. Thanks in advance for your understanding.

### Day 7 Yangzhou (Wu’an Bridge) – Zhenjiang (Wanshan Park (West))

![Day 7 was the latest start time on any non-rest day. This is where I really began to “let myself go.”](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/87.png)

36. **Gaoyou Route 30 Wu’an Bridge – Lingtang Coach Station**  
    There are two bus routes from central Gaoyou to Lingtang Coach Station. Besides Route 30, there’s another one that takes a longer, more time-consuming path. On the stop signs, Gaoyou Route 30 is labeled as “Tourist Route 30.”
    ![Stop sign for Gaoyou Route 30 (Tourist Route 30).](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/88.jpg)
    ![Gaoyou Route 30 bus.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/89.jpg)
    The photo was taken at the terminus. Compared with Wangqiao from the previous day, Lingtang Coach Station is larger and has an indoor waiting room. In addition to buses to and from Gaoyou and Yangzhou, there are a few town and village buses within Lingtang Hui Township. There’s a mosque right across the street from the coach station.

37. **(Yangzhou) Route 33 Lingtang Coach Station – Western Coach Hub (Yangzhou Railway Station West)**  
    There were about six people in the waiting room at Lingtang Coach Station, but I was the only one taking Route 33 to Yangzhou. The driver followed the rules very strictly: when I walked up to his bus, he gestured for me to wait at the coach hall entrance, then pulled into the designated departure bay and let me board there.
    Hearing the “student card” announcement, he asked if I was on vacation, if I studied in Lingtang, and where I was going. I answered each question. He probably didn’t quite understand why a student who didn’t study in Lingtang would show up here during the holidays.
    This bus does not head straight for Yangzhou Railway Station. Instead, it loops through Yizheng City on Yangzhou’s western side before finally arriving at Yangzhou Railway Station.

38. **(Yangzhou) Route 16 Western Coach Hub (Yangzhou Railway Station West) – Runyang Forest Park**  
    This route takes us from Yangzhou’s western suburbs to its southern suburbs.
    ![Coach hub near the railway station. Each bus route has its own dedicated boarding area.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/93.jpg)
    ![(Yangzhou) Route 16 bus at its starting point.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/94.jpg)
    Since I boarded at the railway station, the boarding experience was great. The station also has some interesting routes, like Route 9 below, which shuttles between the Western and Eastern Coach Hubs. Yangzhou was the only city in this whole journey that named its coach stations with such grand terms — “Western Coach Hub,” “Eastern Coach Hub” — it kind of gives off a “China Western Super Hub” vibe lol.
    ![(Yangzhou) Route 9, linking the western and eastern coach hubs of Yangzhou.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/95.jpg)

39. **Zhenjiang–Yangzhou Vehicle Ferry Yangzhou – Zhenjiang**  
    The Zhenjiang–Yangzhou vehicle ferry was the only ferry segment of this journey, and just like the tram, it was something I deliberately planned in. Since both Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are riverfront cities along the Yangtze, the river isn’t far from either city center, so there are many vehicles traveling between them. The cross-river bridge nearest the ferry, the Runyang Bridge, is an expressway bridge, so if you don’t want to make a big detour via the expressway, the ferry is your only real option.
    Once you get off at Runyang Forest Park Stop, you can see the toll booths for the Zhenjiang–Yangzhou ferry. Some people nearby may approach you asking if you need a ride across. One person asked me if I was going to Zhenjiang Railway Station; I could honestly say I wasn’t.
    By the way, the ferry only carries walk-on passengers (pedestrians, two-wheelers, three-wheelers) between 5:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. After 8 p.m., if you want to cross the river, you need to go by vehicle.
    The Zhenjiang–Yangzhou ferry is extremely busy, with heavy vehicle traffic and quite a few walk-on passengers, which made it easy for me to just blend in and follow the crowd into the waiting hall. You enter via a small path next to a distinctive rock, then use a self-service machine to buy tickets. A pedestrian ticket is 3 yuan; the machine prints a QR code on thermal paper, and you scan it at the gates to enter.
    ![Zhenjiang–Yangzhou Ferry, with an inscription by Party Secretary Jiang.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/96.jpg)
    ![Self-service ticket machine at the Zhenjiang–Yangzhou Ferry: 3 yuan for pedestrians, 5 yuan for two-wheelers, 10 yuan for three-wheelers.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/97.jpg)
    A notice near the machine explains that walk-on passenger gates were only introduced in 2022. From what I’ve read, starting in 2017 the ferry stopped carrying walk-on passengers and instead operated shuttle buses across the river, with buses carrying the passengers to improve safety.
    ![Zhenjiang–Yangzhou Ferry notice: walk-on passengers have only been allowed again since 2022.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/98.jpg)
    Various types of preferential cards can be used on the ferry. I saw one passenger call out to the staff from the gate, flash a red card that looked like a retired soldier’s preferential card, and be allowed through.
    There are “no smoking” signs in the waiting hall, but plenty of people still smoke, and the staff don’t intervene. From the hall you can clearly observe how the ferry operation works. Multiple boats can be docked at once. Loading and unloading vehicles do not happen simultaneously: once one boat is full, later vehicles line up for the next one. Only a few of the boats take walk-on passengers, and they dock closest to the pedestrian hall. After all vehicles are loaded, pedestrians are allowed to board.
    ![Boarding the ferry!](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/99.jpg)
    Once on board, pedestrians and vehicles share the same deck. There’s a long, narrow room on the lower deck where walk-on passengers can sit, but the view from inside isn’t great, so I followed other pedestrians and threaded my way between the vehicles from the stern to the bow, where the view was excellent.
    The view across the Yangtze is wide open; you can see a very long way across the water. At the same time, the boat is small and the deck is low, so physically you feel extremely close to the water — a very unique experience. Even though the wind on the river made my hands go numb with cold, I still recorded a video of the whole crossing. It was way more interesting than the usual high-speed-train crossing at Nanjing.
    ![Crossing the Yangtze (part one)!](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/100.jpg)
    ![Crossing the Yangtze (part two)!](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/101.jpg)
    When the ferry arrives in Zhenjiang, it also docks on the side closest to the pedestrian exit. The deck marshal lets pedestrians disembark first; only after everyone reaches a safe area are vehicles allowed to roll off. Nice. In the photo you can also see that the toll booths on the Zhenjiang side are under construction (or renovation).
    Once outside the terminal, you can see a long line of vehicles (mostly freight trucks) waiting to board the ferry back across.
    ![Disembarking — the Zhenjiang-side ferry terminal is under construction.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/102.jpg)
    ![A long line of trucks waiting to board the ferry.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/103.jpg)
    Time actually on the boat is about 10 minutes, but from getting off the bus, buying tickets, waiting, boarding, crossing, and leaving the terminal, the whole process takes around 40 minutes.
    One more fun fact: the Yangzhou terminal used to be called Guazhou Ferry, and there’s a scenic spot nearby called “Guazhou Ancient Ferry,” which is exactly the “Guazhou” mentioned in the line “Between Jingkou and Guazhou lies just a strip of water.”
    ![The Yangzhou terminal was originally called Guazhou Ferry — the “Guazhou” in “between Jingkou and Guazhou lies just a strip of water.”](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/104.jpg)

40. **(Zhenjiang) Route 10 Runzhou Road North Stop – Sanguantang**  
    Route 10 technically starts at the ferry terminal, but since I couldn’t find a bus stop actually called “Ferry Terminal,” and the main road near the terminal was jammed with trucks waiting to board the ferry, plus the fact that all the other pedestrians seemed to be walking ahead anyway, I followed the crowd south to Runzhou Road North Stop and waited there for Route 10.
    When Route 10 arrived, there were already quite a few passengers on board, so clearly the “Ferry Terminal” stop does exist — I just failed to find it.
    Zhenjiang’s bus system was, after Huai’an Route 207’s baked-in 20% discount on the card machine, the first place since leaving Beijing where I fully enjoyed the local card discount (20% off). Route 10’s base fare is 1 yuan; with a card it’s 0.8 yuan. According to what I read online, national transport union cards get the same discounts as local cards in Zhenjiang. From Zhenjiang onwards, the “student card” announcement disappeared.

    ![Passing Zhenjiang Railway Station.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/106.jpg)

41. **(Zhenjiang) Route 633 Canal Road Public Stop – Zhongbei College (East)**  
    I’m guessing the name “Canal Road Public Stop” comes from the fact that both Zhenjiang Bus and Zhenjiang Jiangtian Bus routes serve this stop. Route 633 doesn’t run very often — just 10 trips a day — and when I arrived, I had about a 45-minute wait for the next one.
    Since lunch had just been some bread, I first bought a bottle of water at a nearby shop, then spotted a store called “Yuhong Waterproof” selling baked flatbreads. These flatbreads are similar to the ones from my hometown, baked in a cylindrical oven, but thinner and crisper. They were 2 yuan each. I bought one, and it was so good hot out of the oven that it actually made me hungrier, so I went back for a second and told the owner how much I liked them.
    After finishing the second one I still wanted more, but since I was planning to have a proper dinner in about an hour and a half — and buying a third round might have looked a bit suspicious — I reluctantly stopped there.
    ![The building supplies store that sells amazing flatbreads.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/107.jpg)

    ![(Zhenjiang) Route 633 bus pulling in.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/109.jpg)

42. **Danyang Route 15 Zhongbei College (East) – Wanshan Park (West)**  
    I didn’t get a photo of the vehicle. Above the Danyang bus stop signs there’s this mysterious logo, the same one I saw at Lingtang Coach Station. Turns out it’s the Jiangsu Passenger Transport logo.
    ![Zhongbei College (East) bus stop sign.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/110.jpg)

That was the end of today’s journey.

### Day 8 Zhenjiang (Wanshan Park (West)) – Suzhou (Shengze Plaza)

![On Day 8, the original plan was to journey for 14 hours and reach Xianghu to connect to the following segments. Later I extended the journey by one day, stayed in Hangzhou the next day to pick up my luggage, and rested.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/112.png)

43. **Danyang Route 209 / Route 209 Branch Wanshan Park (West) – Lücheng Terminal**  
    I stayed near Wanshan Park the previous night. Both Danyang Route 209 and its branch line can cover this segment; the branch runs less frequently and has longer intervals, while travel times are about the same. I ended up taking regular Route 209.
    ![Wanshan Park (West) bus stop sign.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/113.jpg)
    ![Danyang Route 209 bus pulling in.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/114.jpg)
    Lücheng Terminal is an important transport hub in Lücheng Town. Besides Route 209 and its branch, the terminal is also the start/end point for Danyang Route 208, Changzhou Route 34 (which I’d take next), and Danyang’s rural loop bus in Lücheng Town, Danyang Route 326. You could say it covers both “macro” and “micro” transport. There’s no actual station building here; the only structure in the terminal is the small office cabin in the photo below. When I arrived there was a light drizzle, so I just hid under the shelter on the platform. A light winter rain in the south, plus a bit of wind, is enough to feel properly cold.
    ![Lücheng bus terminal. It’s drizzling; winter in the south feels colder than in the north.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/115.jpg)

    ![Danyang Route 209 branch departing the stop.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/118.jpg)

44. **Changzhou Route 34 Lücheng Terminal – West Xinxin Bridge West**  
    Compared with Danyang’s buses, Changzhou Route 34 clearly uses larger and newer vehicles, and ridership from the starting stop was decent. Changzhou buses give a 40% discount on local card taps, and the national transport union card is treated the same.
    ![Changzhou Route 34 bus.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/119.jpg)
    While riding Route 34, I made major changes to the plan for the day. Originally I’d planned to take Route 34 into central Changzhou, transfer to Metro Lines 2 and 1, then from Changzhou Railway Station or nearby Bo’ai Road stop catch Changzhou Route K1 (reportedly very busy) to Xueyan Town, and from the Xueyan bus station take Wuxi Route 26 into downtown Wuxi.
    But en route on Route 34, I checked Baidu Maps for routes and real-time buses and noticed a path to Wuxi I’d never seen before: via Jiangyin, using Wuxi Metro Line S1 into Wuxi. Looking up the news, I realized that today coincided with a three-day trial operation period of Wuxi Metro S1, so I immediately decided to change course.

45. **(Changzhou) BRT Route 1 West Xinxin Bridge – Changcheng Road Longqi Road**  
    One bonus of this reroute was that I could now ride Changzhou’s BRT Route 1 — my second BRT of the trip. Compared with Zaozhuang’s BRT, Changzhou’s is closer to what I imagine proper BRT to be: dedicated platforms, special vehicles, and dedicated lanes.
    The West Xinxin Bridge platform is in the middle of the road, so you reach it via a footbridge. The buses are double-deckers; I chose the front row on the upper deck. Unfortunately, because of the cold weather, the front window on the upper level was completely fogged up, so there was no forward view.
    ![(Changzhou) BRT Route 1 platform.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/120.jpg)
    ![(Changzhou) BRT Route 1 vehicle.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/121.jpg)

46. **Jiangyin–Changzhou Intercity Bus Longhutang – Lixin Road**  
    The Jiangyin–Changzhou intercity bus has no route number but operates very much like a bus and is run by Jiangyin Bus. Stops along the way are marked with “Jiangyin ↔ Changzhou” route info. As the bus approaches Jiangyin, the driver asks passengers where they want to get off. After I got off, there were no passengers left, and I saw the driver turn around at the next intersection and head straight back, no longer going all the way to the official terminus at Jiangyin High-Speed Rail Station.
    ![Jiangyin–Changzhou intercity bus, operating in bus mode.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/122.jpg)

47. **Wuxi Metro Line S1 Jiangyin Chinese Medicine Hospital – Mazhen (stayed on board, did not alight)**  
    The exit of Jiangyin Chinese Medicine Hospital Station leads directly to the hospital, and right next to it is Jiangyin City Air Terminal, which, judging from the sign, serves flights from Sunan Shuofang International Airport and Changzhou International Airport. Line S1 uses red as its line color with white as the background on signage and station entrances.
    ![Wuxi Metro Line S1 signage.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/123.jpg)
    ![Jiangyin City Air Terminal.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/124.jpg)
    ![Entrance to Wuxi Metro Line S1.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/125.jpg)
    Even at this station, S1’s ridership was already quite high, with plenty of people at both the entrances and the concourse. The ticket machines were shut down and covered with a “Trial Operation” notice, and the gates were wide open. Screens in the concourse were already showing line information; it would have been even nicer if they displayed upcoming train times. Overall, the concourse design is simple and spacious, without too many decorative elements.
    ![Wayfinding signs inside Wuxi Metro Line S1.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/126.jpg)
    ![During the S1 trial operation, all Wuxi Metro lines were free to ride.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/127.jpg)
    On the platform, above the platform screen doors, is a complete station list for both Wuxi Metro Line S1 and Line 1 — the two lines run through. According to available information, S1 and Line 1 do run through services, but since they use different train types and have different top speeds, it’s probably “S1 trains continue onto Line 1,” while the original Line 1 trains turn back at Mazhen and run as a short shuttle. There are no S1 short-turn shuttles.
    Fun detail: there were already ads on the line even during the trial phase — good for them.
    ![Station sign at Wuxi Metro Line S1 Jiangyin Chinese Medicine Hospital Station (part one).](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/129.jpg)

    ![Through operation between Wuxi Metro Line S1 and Line 1 — onboard display.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/128.jpg)
    The ridership on board was pretty wild; most people seemed to be here just to experience the new line. Lots of conversations were basically, “Have you ever ridden the metro before?” or “Should we get off and head back now?” The train’s display screens still had the text “Line S1 has not yet opened.”
    ![Trial run day on Wuxi Metro Line S1 — absolutely packed.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/131.jpg)

48. **Wuxi Metro Line 1 Mazhen – Wuxi Railway Station**  
    Since the trains run through, I didn’t take any extra photos for this segment. One more side note: the first station exclusive to S1, Qingyang, is an above-ground station and appears to have provisions for two additional platforms.

49. **Wuxi Metro Line 3 Wuxi Railway Station – Shuofang Airport**  
    Line 3 has “strong-cool” and “weak-cool” cars: the middle cars are strongly air-conditioned and the ones on either side are weakly cooled (the opposite of, say, Beijing’s Line 10 and friends). The Line 3 trains I rode were clearly older than S1’s; they still use LED dot-matrix displays for station announcements.
    ![Wuxi Metro Line 3 uses separate cooling zones (strong vs weak) — in January, no less.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/132.jpg)

    ![Station sign at Wuxi Railway Station on Metro Line 3.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/134.jpg)

50. **Su-Xi Bus Line 1 Sunan Shuofang International Airport – Huning Intercity New District**  
    Shuofang Airport is the only airport transfer point in this entire journey. There’s been some debate about what to call it — “Wuxi Shuofang” or “Sunan Shuofang.” At a huge transport hub like an airport, you really need to leave a big buffer for transfers.
    Unfortunately, when I arrived at the Shuofang Airport metro station, there were only 2 minutes left before the next bus departure. Even with an all-out sprint, there was no way I could make it, so I ended up stuck at the airport for 30 minutes.
    To reach Su-Xi Bus Line 1 from the metro, you go up to the arrivals level after exiting the station and can easily spot the signs on the ground. It’s clear this route is quite important: it has a large dedicated platform, cushioned waiting benches, LED screens, and separate waiting lanes for the two directions with projected signage.
    Interestingly, the route doesn’t start or end at the airport; it has two directions because it runs through. Given that it’s an important link between Shuofang Airport and Suzhou and costs only 2 yuan for the whole ride, it makes perfect sense that it gets this level of attention. Another fun detail: the LED screens on the platform say “Wuxi Shuofang,” while the station signs below use “Sunan Shuofang.”
    ![Dedicated waiting area for Su-Xi Bus Line 1 at the airport.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/135.jpg)
    ![Prominent departure bays for Su-Xi Bus Line 1.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/136.jpg)
    The vehicles on Su-Xi Bus Line 1 aren’t particularly large, but ridership is decent. When I tapped my card, the reader announced it as a “non-local card,” with no discount. Inside, the stop announcements say “Suzhou Bus,” and the logo on board reads “New District Bus,” presumably referring to “Huning Intercity New District.” I did a resupply stop after arriving at Huning Intercity New District.

51. **Suzhou Metro Line 3 Suzhou New District Railway Station – Baodai Road**  
    Suzhou Metro Line 3 starts at Suzhou New District Railway Station. Every time I tap my national transport union card on Suzhou buses/metro, the system announces/displays “non-local card,” but it does recognize it as a student card — and still charges the full 8 yuan for the two metro segments, with no discount at all.
    ![Suzhou New District Railway Station.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/140.jpg)
    ![Entrance to Suzhou Metro Line 3.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/141.jpg)
    Lines 3 and 11 in Suzhou have a wonderfully weird through-running pattern: over a full A–B–C stretch, Line 3 covers A–B and Line 11 covers B–C. As a result, the line map above the platform screen doors on Line 3 is extremely long. Line 11 connects to the Shanghai metro network at Huaqiao Station.
    When the northern extension of Line 3 opens and is connected to Sunan Shuofang International Airport, it will essentially replace the role of Su-Xi Bus Line 1, and it’ll be theoretically possible to ride the metro from Shanghai’s Bund to Jiangyin’s riverside via one continuous network.
    ![Through operation between Suzhou Metro Lines 3 and 11. In the future this will create a fun chain: Jiangyin waterfront – Wuxi Railway Station – Sunan Shuofang – Huaqiao – Zhenru – Shanghai Bund (Yuyuan).](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/142.jpg)

52. **Suzhou Metro Line 4 Baodai Road – Wujiang People’s Square**  
    If you ignore the water area of Taihu Lake, Suzhou’s administrative area is long north–south and narrow east–west. Within Suzhou, my route needed to enter from the north and exit from the south, so every leg within the city pushed me further south.
    This segment on Line 4 took me to the southernmost place reachable by the Suzhou metro: near Wujiang People’s Square (the true southernmost station is the previous one, Songling Avenue). Note that Line 4 has a southern branch, so you need to pick the correct branch when boarding.

53. **(Suzhou) Route 718 Wujiang Building South – Shengze Plaza**  
    The last leg of the day was Route 718, which took me deep into Suzhou’s southern end, to Shengze Town in Wujiang District. The bus was driven extremely “by the book” — so much so that I wasn’t entirely sure it was all strictly necessary. It stopped at every single stop, only moved off after fully opening and closing the doors, and always stopped for pedestrians at crosswalks while turning at intersections.
    Shengze Plaza, where I got off, is the terminus. After everyone disembarked, the driver turned off the LED display, so the bus in the photo has no destination shown. When I tapped my national transport union card, the fare displayed was 0 yuan — apparently I’d finally triggered a transfer discount, the only one of the entire journey.
    ![(Suzhou) Route 718 bus arriving — the driver has already turned off the destination display.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/145.jpg)
    After getting off, I was immediately amazed by the urban landscape of this so-called “town.” The high-rises and streetscape in front of me looked nothing like what you’d usually associate with a “town,” and frankly surpassed some of the county-level cities I’d visited earlier in the journey.
    I didn’t take photos on the walk to my hotel, but the commercial street near where I stayed was packed with jewelry shops.
    ![This “town” is far more prosperous than some of the “cities” I visited at the start of the journey.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/146.jpg)

That was the end of today’s journey.

### Day 9 Suzhou (Oriental Plaza) – Hangzhou (Jiubao)

![Day 9: the journey finally reaches Jiubao.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/148.png)

55. **(Suzhou) Route 767 Oriental Plaza – No. 1 Town East Bridge – Yizhong Shundong Campus**  
    From Oriental Plaza to the next boarding point near No. 1 Town East Bridge is less than 3 km, and there are several routes that can get you there; I just took the earliest one. I didn’t get a photo of the bus.

56. **(Jiaxing) Route 276 No. 1 Town East Bridge – Jiaxing Coach North Station**  
    Jiaxing Route 276 actually starts from Shengze Coach Station, so if you don’t need to stop in between, you could transfer directly from yesterday’s end point.
    ![No. 1 Town East Bridge stop sign for (Jiaxing) Route 276.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/149.jpg)
    ![(Jiaxing) Route 276 bus pulling in.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/150.jpg)
    On board, Jiaxing buses have a fun “Safety Guardian Seat,” meaning that whoever sits there automatically becomes the safety guardian of the bus. I think this is a pretty clever design — you get the idea of a safety officer without actually having to hire one.
    ![“Safety Guardian Seat.”](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/151.jpg)

57. **(Jiaxing) Route 20 Jiaxing Coach North Station West – Cuiliu Road / Youquan Road**  
    Because Haining Leather City is such a big deal, there are many “one-transfer” combinations from near the coach north station to get there, even though there’s no single direct route.
    On Jiaxing Route 20, some seats have USB charging ports, which is honestly very advanced and very welcome. At the transfer point I found a noodle shop — cheap, delicious eel stir-fried dry noodles, very close to Su-style noodles.

58. **(Jiaxing) Route 181 Huafu Yaobai Department Store West – Leather City**  
    I didn’t get a photo of the bus. Even though the bus stop is called Leather City and the Hangzhou–Haining Intercity line’s station is also called Leather City, going from “Leather City” (bus) to “Leather City” (intercity rail) still requires walking across the entire Leather City complex.
    ![Haining Leather City (part one).](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/156.jpg)
    ![Haining Leather City (part two).](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/157.jpg)

59. **Hangzhou–Haining Intercity Railway Leather City – Linping South High-Speed Rail Station**  
    The Hangzhou–Haining Intercity Railway connects into the Hangzhou metro fare system and uses unified ticketing, but construction and operations belong to Zhejiang Communications Investment Group. Its interior fittings also differ from Hangzhou Metro.
    At Exit D of Leather City Station there’s a fun slogan on the wall (pictured below), and the concourse restrooms include a mother-and-baby room.
    ![Entrance of Leather City Station on the Hangzhou–Haining Intercity.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/158.jpg)

    ![Mother-and-baby room in the concourse of the Hangzhou–Haining Intercity.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/160.jpg)
    The line uses all-soft-seat configurations and 4-car B-type trains. From Xieqiao Station to Xucun Station the line is above ground. At Xieqiao Station I noticed separate through and platform tracks, which would make it possible to run limited-stop express services. According to available info, though, there’s currently only one pair of express trains per day.

60. **Hangzhou Metro Line 9 Linping South High-Speed Rail Station – Coach Center**  
    On this journey, the Linping South High-Speed Rail Station–Coach Center section of Line 9 was originally a branch of Line 1, and Linping South High-Speed Rail Station itself used to be called Yuhang High-Speed Rail Station.
    As Hangzhou’s administrative divisions were adjusted, the former “Yuhang High-Speed Rail Station” ended up no longer being in today’s Yuhang District at all, but in Linping District, so the station was renamed Linping South High-Speed Rail Station. At the same time, the former Line 1 branch had completed its historical mission, was renumbered as Line 9, and extended further south. Before Line 9 existed, the last two legs of this journey could have been combined into one big segment.
    Also, you don’t need to exit the gates to transfer between the Hangzhou–Haining Intercity and Line 9 here.

61. **Hangzhou Metro Line 1 Coach Center – Jiubao**  
    Hangzhou Metro Line 1 is the first metro line I ever rode, and the first segment I ever took was from Chengzhan to Wujiang Road. Today I rode just one stop on Line 1; after arriving at Jiubao Station, the journey was complete.
    The train I took still uses the blinking-LED-style line diagram, now plastered with a lot of stickers. The first time I ever saw stickers pasted on top of stickers on a metro map was in Hangzhou, so I hereby crown Hangzhou Metro the “Sticker King.”
    ![Blinking-LED line map on Hangzhou Metro Line 1 — the Sticker King.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/165.jpg)
    ![Platform at Jiubao Station on Hangzhou Metro Line 1.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/166.jpg)
    After exiting Jiubao Station, I noticed something amusing: half of the ticket machines in the concourse were shut down, and above them was a sign “We recommend using QR codes to ride,” followed by seven whole QR codes for seven different apps: Hangzhou Metro, Alipay, WeChat, Hangzhou Citizen Card, UnionPay QuickPass, Digital RMB, and Hangzhou Public Transport.
    ![Ticket machines urging you to use seven different ride QR codes — truly the city of QR codes.](/assets/local-assets/posts/travel-L001-PK-HZ/167.jpg)
    That was the end of today’s journey. With that, the entire journey is over — time to head into Jiubao to hang out with Lalala. Huge thanks to Lalala for transporting part of my luggage from Beijing to Hangzhou. The picture below is a little easter egg — see you next time!
